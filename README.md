## About

"Universal Pong" is an ambitious personal project dedicated to recreating the timeless classic, Pong, across a multitude of programming languages. The primary goal is to explore the unique characteristics, libraries, and development paradigms of each language while building a functional and faithful rendition of the game. This repository serves as a central hub for all the different language implementations, showcasing the versatility and power of various programming ecosystems.

## Project Status

This project is currently under active development. As of now, implementations for Java, Python, and JavaScript are in progress or completed. More languages will be added as the project evolves.

## Technologies Used

This section outlines the specific technologies and libraries used for each language implementation.

### Java Implementation

**Directory:** `java/`

**Description:** The Java version of Pong aims to be a robust and performant desktop application. It leverages standard Java AWT/Swing for graphics or potentially a more modern library like JavaFX.

**Key Technologies:**

* **Java Development Kit (JDK):** Version 17+ recommended.
* **AWT/Swing:** For basic graphics and event handling (initial implementation).
* **Maven/Gradle:** For build automation and dependency management. (To be implemented for larger projects)
* **(Optional) JavaFX:** For more modern UI capabilities (future consideration).

### Python Implementation

**Directory:** `python/`

**Description:** The Python implementation focuses on simplicity and rapid development, utilizing popular game development libraries available in the Python ecosystem.

**Key Technologies:**

* **Python:** Version 3.8+ recommended.
* **Pygame:** A set of Python modules designed for writing video games, providing robust functionalities for graphics, sound, and input handling.
* **(Optional) Tkinter/Pyglet:** For alternative GUI or game development approaches (exploratory).

### JavaScript Implementation

**Directory:** `javascript/`

**Description:** The JavaScript version of Pong is designed to be a web-based game, playable directly in a browser. It utilizes standard web technologies for rendering and interactivity.

**Key Technologies:**

* **HTML5:** For the game structure and canvas element.
* **CSS3:** For basic styling and layout.
* **JavaScript (ES6+):** For game logic, rendering, and event handling.
* **Canvas API:** For drawing game elements directly onto the HTML canvas.
* **(Optional) Phaser.js/PixiJS:** For more advanced 2D game development (future consideration for complex features).

## How to Run

Instructions on how to set up and run each language's version of Pong.

### Java

1.  **Navigate:** Change directory to `java/`.
2.  **Compile:** If using standard Java compilation: `javac -d out src/main/java/com/universalpong/*.java` (adjust path as needed). If using Maven/Gradle, follow their respective build commands.
3.  **Run:** `java -cp out com.universalpong.PongGame` (adjust package and main class as needed).

### Python

1.  **Navigate:** Change directory to `python/`.
2.  **Install Dependencies:** `pip install -r requirements.txt` (if a `requirements.txt` file exists).
3.  **Run:** `python main.py` (or the name of your main game file).

### JavaScript

1.  **Navigate:** Change directory to `javascript/`.
2.  **Open in Browser:** Open the `index.html` file directly in your web browser.
